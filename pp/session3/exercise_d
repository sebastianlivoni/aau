Here is a Haskell expression.

[(+),(*),(+),(-)]

What does it contain and what is the type of the expression? Find the answer without asking the
Haskell interpreter. Explain why your answer is correct. Then (and only then!) ask the Haskell
interpreter what the type is.

[(+),(*),(+),(-)] :: Num a => [a -> a -> a]

[(+),(*),(+),(-),(++)]
